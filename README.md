At the time of writing, the Windows versions that are still in the support of Microsoft include Windows 8.1 (2013 to 2023), Windows 10 (2015 to 2025), and Windows 11 (2021 to —). Therefore, if you refer to big versions, the latest Windows version is Windows 11. If you refer to small versions, please keep reading.

However, you should note that the mainstream support for Windows 8.1 has been already ended in 2018, which means that no new releases, updates, services packs, builds, fixes, and patches would be provided for Windows 8.1.

## How to Upgrade to the Latest Windows Version?

If you think your small version is old and you want to upgrade to the latest Windows 10/11 version, the method is very simple. For a Windows 10 PC, the process is as follows:

* Press Windows key + I to open the Settings
* Go to Update & Security > Windows Update.
* Click Check for updates. If there are available updates, the PC will download and install automatically and you just need to click the Restart now button. If there are available optional updates, you can click Download and install to get them.

_For a Windows 11 PC, the update process is similar, but the Windows 11 Settings window has a difference and you can select Windows Update directly from the Settings window._

## What version of windows should I install?

Windows 10 64-bit is recommended if you have 4 GB or more RAM. Windows 10 64-bit supports up to 2 TB of RAM, while Windows 10 32-bit can utilize up to 3.2 GB. The memory address space for 64-bit Windows is much larger, which means you need twice as much memory than 32-bit Windows to accomplish some of the same tasks.
